# Project : Succor

## Team Members : Tarah Perry, Mat Stover, and Andrew Davies

## Project Description:
Here at Succor we’re trying to make the world a little bit better for charities that need aid and those that want to provide help by making the connection process a little bit easier. Sometimes charities that need help can’t or don’t know how to connect with the volunteers the need to complete their missions. Our goal is to connect others so we can help our communities and in turn the world.  

## How it Works
1. Provide us with your location
2. Provide us with a little information about what type or category of help you want to contribute
3. We pair a charity in need of aid with those that want to provide aid.
